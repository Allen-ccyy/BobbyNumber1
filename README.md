Project Name: Magic Matrix;

Requirements: Should have a working prototype of the game, a login and sign up page, a LeaderBoard to record the scores of the players, as well as a page for admin to manage user data;

Data: 11/04/2019, version 1.0

Abstract: Magical Matrix is a brain practice web application game. When playing this game, the screen will display an N*N matrix (N will get larger as game goes), each element in the matrix will be displayed as a square. At the beginning of each round, some randomly assigned squares will be colored differently, after 3 seconds, those squares will be turned back to normal color, then the whole matrix will be rotated either right or left (also random), players are supposed to memorize the colored ones and select them all in order to pass the level. Users can retrieve their password via emails they used when signing up and users can use google account to authenticate logins(API).

Customer: This game is focusing on people who wanted to train their memory skills or want to spend their spare time, such as teenagers and seniors.

Competitive Analysis: There might be similar games in the market, however, in the future, we are implementing something that has never been seen before! Firstly, we introduce the online vs mode, players can compete their scores with other players in real time! Secondly, players can interact with each other while they are competing! (such as throwing an egg or thumb up/down).
